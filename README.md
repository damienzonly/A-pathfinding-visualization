# Running instructions
  With the right click you set the walls, obstacles,  on the grid. With the first left click you set the Start point, with the          second click the End point. Note that each the walls, start point and end point can overwrite other cells, so be carefull to select different cells (this will be correct as soon as possible).

  The algorithm starts soon after the end point selection, so place the walls before, then the start point and the end point.
