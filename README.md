# A* pathfinding  algorithm visualization
  This is my first A* algorithm implementation made in python and pygame. Suggestions are higly recommended

# Python packages needed:
  -math<br/>
  -pygame<br/>
  -collections<br/>
  you can easly install all of them by typing 'pip install packagename' in terminal with root permission (python needed of course)

# Usage
  RIGHT CLICK : set wall<br/>
  HOLD LEFT CLICK + S : set the start node<br/>
  HOLD LEFT CLICK + E : set the end node (note that as soon as the end node is seted the algorithm starts)<br/>
  HOLD LEFT CLICK + D : delete a wall<br/>
  C : clear grid<br/>
  Note that each the walls, start point and end point can overwrite other cells, so be carefull to select different cells (this will be correct as soon as possible).
