# A* pathfinding  algorithm visualization
  This is my first A* algorithm implementation made in python and pygame. Suggestions are higly recommended

# Python packages needed:
  -math<br/>
  -pygame<br/>
  -collections<br/>
  you can easly install all of them by typing 'pip install packagename' in terminal with root permission (python needed of course)

# Usage
  RIGHT CLICK : set wall<br/>
  HOLD LEFT CLICK + S : set the start node<br/>
  HOLD LEFT CLICK + E : set the end node <br/>
  HOLD LEFT CLICK + D : delete a wall<br/>
  C : clear grid<br/>
  START BUTTON : to start the algorithm
  Note that each the walls, start point and end point can overwrite other cells, so be carefull to select different cells (this will be correct as soon as possible).
